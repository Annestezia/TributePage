				<p>Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou (25 June 1963 – 25 December 2016), known professionally as George Michael, was an English singer, songwriter, and record producer who rose to fame as a member of the music duo Wham! He was best known for his work in the 1980s and 1990s, including hit singles such as "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" and "Last Christmas", and albums such as Faith (1987) and Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 (1990). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Michael" title="Wikipedia"><small> Read more >> </small></a></p>

					<p>There is no such thing as a reluctant star. Stars are almost always people that want to make up for their own weaknesses by being loved by the public and I'm no exception to that.</p>

					<p>George Michael was no stranger to the headlines. His private life was often offered up for public consumption. But his philanthropy was not as widely reported.</p>
					<p>Since his death, stories have emerged that reveal his generous, often spontaneous, acts of kindness.</p>
					<p>Childline’s founder and president, Dame Esther Rantzen, revealed that Michael had given the royalties from his 1996 number one single Jesus to a Child to the charity.          </p>
