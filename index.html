	        <p>George Michael was no stranger to the headlines. His private life was often offered up for public consumption. But his philanthropy was not as widely reported.</p>

	        <p>Since his death, stories have emerged that reveal his generous, often spontaneous, acts of kindness.</p>
	       <p>Childline’s founder and president, Dame Esther Rantzen, revealed that Michael had given the royalties from his 1996 number one single Jesus to a Child to the charity.          </p>
